### Abstract Factory Pattern

<p>The example in this code give us a summary on how to use the abstract factory pattern. This method consists of a "factory of factories", which
is useful in problems where we need to define a collection of objects that depends on other collection of objects. The "factory is factories" is responsible
for generating the corresponding factory (according to a config file) that then will build the elements to be shown on the screen.
