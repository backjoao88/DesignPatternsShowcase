#### Builder Pattern

<p>This pattern focus on solving the problem of creating an object that has multiple parameters and grouping of objects by creating
the object in a step by step way. The way i see is that this pattern allow us to write object in a "fluent way", more than just reduce the complexity
of creating objects in most cases.</p>
